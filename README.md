# ss-auth

*Stupid-Simple Authentication*

This project contains code which shows how to implement your own user
authentication in a Node.js web app with MongoDB.

This project is meant to go along with the talk I gave at Twilio Signal 2017.
The talk walks you through how authentication works, from the ground up.

I'll update this README with a link to the finished talk recording and slides
once they are live.


## Installation

Installing this project is simple, run the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/rdegges/ss-auth.git
$ cd ss-auth
$ npm install
$ npm start      # fire up the project!
```

**NOTE**: You must have MongoDB installed and working locally in order to run
this project.  It will work with all the default MongoDB options.


## Purpose

This project shows how to implement basic user authentication in a Node web app.
The accompanying talk explains how HTTP authentication works in a ground up way,
explaining how each little piece works behind the scenes.

If you've ever wanted to know how authentication works, see the accompanying
talk.
